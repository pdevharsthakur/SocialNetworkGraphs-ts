## üìÑ Files

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Some of these files are used by our graders so please do not modify them if you would like to use the user-side graders to test your code. You are welcome to make copies of them and modify them.

### Test Network

#### <a id="small_test_graph"></a> `small_test_graph.txt`

- **Description:** Small test graph for algorithm verification and debugging
- **Size:** 14 nodes, 34 edges
- **Characteristics:** Fully connected, suitable for quick testing

### Facebook Networks

#### <a id="facebook_ucsd"></a> `facebook_ucsd.txt`

- **Description:** Facebook friendships between students at UCSD in 2005
- **Size:** ~14,000 nodes, ~450,000 edges
- **Format:** Directed edges (each edge also appears in reverse order, making the final result undirected)
- **Original Format:** Matlab sparse matrix, processed with Python for easier reading
- **Source:** [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/oxford-2005-facebook-matrix)
- **Citation:**
  > Facebook data scrape related to paper "The Social Structure of Facebook Networks", by Amanda L. Traud, Peter J. Mucha, Mason A. Porter.

#### <a id="facebook_1000txt"></a> `facebook_1000.txt`

- **Description:** Smaller version of facebook_ucsd.txt containing only the first 1000 vertices
- **Size:** 1,000 nodes, ~15,000 edges
- **Characteristics:** Fully connected network
- **Use Case:** Good for initial testing of algorithms that might be slow on larger datasets

#### <a id="facebook_2000txt"></a> `facebook_2000.txt`

- **Description:** Smaller version of facebook_ucsd.txt containing only the first 2000 vertices
- **Size:** 2,000 nodes, ~30,000 edges
- **Characteristics:** Not fully connected
- **Use Case:** Useful for testing algorithms with large runtimes and analyzing disconnected components

### Twitter Networks

#### <a id="twitter_combinedtxt"></a> `twitter_combined.txt`

- **Description:** Directed edges linking Twitter followers to the users they follow
- **Size:** ~80,000 nodes, ~1.8 million edges
- **Format:** Each line represents a follower relationship
- **Source:** [Stanford's Snap Network Database](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Twitter.html)

#### <a id="twitter_higgstxt"></a> `twitter_higgs.txt`

- **Description:** People who retweeted messages of others at the time of the Higgs boson discovery
- **Size:** ~450,000 nodes, ~14 million edges
- **Research Value:** Shows information propagation around a significant scientific event
- **Source:** [Stanford's Snap Network Database](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/higgs-twitter.html)

## üìã File Format

In all of the files, each line represents an edge in the following format:

```
source_vertex_id target_vertex_id
```

Example:

```
1 2  // User 1 follows/is connected to User 2
```

## üìà Working with Large Datasets

When working with the larger datasets (especially `twitter_higgs.txt`):

- Consider sampling or using smaller datasets during initial development
- Ensure your algorithms can handle large sparse graphs efficiently
- For viral simulations, choose starting nodes carefully as results may vary significantly
